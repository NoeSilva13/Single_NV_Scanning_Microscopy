    This probe is what justifies ``RFSOC_MAX_COUNTING_WINDOW_S``: feed a stable
    pulse source and look for the first length where the rate stops matching the
    short-window reference. Everything below that point can be used as one ADC
    window per pixel, which removes the need to split a dwell at all.

    QICK warns above 2**16 samples about overflowing the sum buffer, but that
    warning is about accumulating 15-bit analog samples in a 32-bit word and
    does not apply to an edge count. A run against an 80 kHz source stayed
    proportional from 13 µs to 2 ms, with no sign of the 16-bit truncation that
    would have zeroed the 131072-sample point.

    The ladder reaches *max_seconds*, 5 s by default, which is most of what a
    single shot can schedule: past roughly 7 s the window no longer fits the
    tProc immediate. Each window costs at most *budget_seconds*, so expect the
    default sweep to run a minute or two. The gap between windows is a fixed
    100 µs rather than a second copy of the window, which at these lengths would
    both double the sweep and overrun that same immediate.

    Read ``ratio_to_first`` knowing that the reference is the shortest and
    therefore coarsest window: with a periodic source its own quantisation
    biases every ratio by a fixed factor. Check ``counts_per_shot`` before
    blaming a falling ratio on the window, because the accumulator is 32-bit
    signed and a bright source saturating it looks exactly like a counter that
    wraps.
